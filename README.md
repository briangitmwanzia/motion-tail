Watched a tutorial made for C++ and came up with python version.

Required modules:
1. pip install numpy if you don't got it already

    out if u don't want to resize
  > You will need the LATEST version of numpy. Earlier versions
    caused problems in my python 2.7
2. To get opencv just follow these easy steps:
